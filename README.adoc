:description: BlackBox is a solution to automatically generate Groovy Semantic logging code and inject it into User code during the Compilation stage resulting in a possibility to produce and review exhaustive application runtime data in a form of XML files with XSD model based on simplified Groovy AST class model - by the means of developing and using a BlackBox Annotation,Groovy Annotation.

== Purpose
{description}

== In short
BlackBox Annotation automatically injects a lot of logging code into user-defined Groovy methods/constructors without affecting the user program logic. +
Granularity of injected code can be defined by the user (programmer) up to:

* Method Exception handling transformation, Method Exceptions logging (exception and causing method arguments are logged)
* Method transformation, Method invocation logging (method arguments and result are logged)
* Statement transformation, Statement-level logging
* Expression transformation, Expression-level logging
